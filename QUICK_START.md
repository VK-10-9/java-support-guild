# Quick Start Guide

## Setting Up Your Java Environment

### Step 1: Install Java JDK

#### For Windows:
1. Download JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Add `JAVA_HOME` pointing to JDK installation directory
   - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to your PATH variable

#### Verify Installation:
Open Command Prompt and type:
```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Development Environment

#### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended for beginners)
1. Install VS Code
2. Install "Extension Pack for Java" extension
3. Open your java-lab folder in VS Code

#### Option 2: Command Line
1. Use any text editor (Notepad++, Sublime Text)
2. Compile: `javac FileName.java`
3. Run: `java ClassName`

#### Option 3: Full IDE
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (Free)
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

Create a test file `HelloWorld.java`:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is working!");
        System.out.println("Ready to start learning!");
    }
}
```

Compile and run:
```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

## Directory Structure

Your java-lab directory is organized as follows:

```
java-lab/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Main overview and navigation

## Learning Path

### Week 1: Getting Started
1. Read `BEGINNERS_GUIDE.md` completely
2. Set up your development environment
3. Complete Programs 1-5 from `programs/week1-2/`
4. Practice exercises 1-5 from `exercises/basic-exercises.md`

### Week 2: Control Structures
1. Study control structures in `BEGINNERS_GUIDE.md`
2. Complete Programs 6-10 from `programs/week1-2/`
3. Practice exercises 6-10 from `exercises/basic-exercises.md`
4. Try creating simple menu-driven programs

### Week 3: Arrays and Methods
1. Complete programs from `programs/week3-4/`
2. Practice array manipulation exercises
3. Learn method creation and overloading
4. Work on string processing problems

### Week 4 onwards: OOP Concepts
1. Follow the weekly program structure
2. Focus on understanding concepts, not just syntax
3. Practice exercises after each week's topics
4. Start building small projects

## Daily Study Routine

### Minimum 1 Hour Daily:
- **20 minutes**: Read theory and concepts
- **30 minutes**: Write and practice code
- **10 minutes**: Debug and test programs

### Weekly Goals:
- Complete assigned lab programs
- Practice additional exercises
- Review previous week's concepts
- Work on a mini-project using learned concepts

## Common Commands

### Compilation and Execution:
```bash
# Compile Java file
javac FileName.java

# Run compiled class
java ClassName

# Compile with classpath
javac -cp . FileName.java

# Run with classpath
java -cp . ClassName
```

### Package Commands:
```bash
# Compile file in package
javac -d . PackageFile.java

# Run class from package
java packagename.ClassName
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "javac is not recognized"
- **Solution**: Add Java bin directory to PATH
- **Check**: Environment variables are set correctly

#### 2. "Could not find or load main class"
- **Solution**: Ensure class name matches file name
- **Check**: main method signature is correct

#### 3. "Public class must be in a file named..."
- **Solution**: File name must match public class name exactly

#### 4. "Package does not exist"
- **Solution**: Check import statements and classpath

1. **Plan First**: Design before coding
2. **Use OOP Principles**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation
3. **Document Code**: Add comments and README files
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Try different inputs and edge cases

## Success Tips

### For Beginners:
1. **Don't Rush**: Take time to understand each concept

4. **Ask Questions**: No question is too simple
5. **Build Projects**: Apply concepts in real scenarios

### For Better Grades:
1. **Submit on Time**: Late submissions often lose marks
2. **Follow Standards**: Use proper naming conventions
3. **Add Comments**: Explain your logic
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Show you've thought about all scenarios
5. **Be Original**: Write your own code, understand every line
